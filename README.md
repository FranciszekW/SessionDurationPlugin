### IntelliJ IDE plugin to show current session duration time on the status bar.

How to run?
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDE
3. Build the plugin using gradle (the "Run Plugin" button next to the green arrow)

*Note: For the timer to actually start, you need to open/create a project in the IDE.
That makes sense, since the plugin is meant to track the time you spend actually working,
not staring at the IDE splash screen. When the timer starts, changing between projects does NOT reset it.*
